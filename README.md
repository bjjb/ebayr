# Ebayr

Ebayr is a small gem which makes it a little easier to use the eBay Trading API
with Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ebayr'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ebayr

## Usage

To use the eBay Trading API, you'll need a developer keyset. Sign up at
http://developer.ebay.com if you haven't already done so.

Next, you'll need to require Ebayr, and tell it to use your keys. You will also
need to generate an RUName, and get the key for that. (This is all standard
stuff - look at the [eBay developer docs][1] for details).

```ruby
require 'ebayr'

Ebayr.dev_id = "my-dev-id"

# This is only needed if you want to retrieve user tokens
Ebayr.authorization_callback_url = "https://my-site/callback-url"

Ebayr.auth_token = "myverylongebayauthtoken"

Ebayr.app_id = "my-ebay-app-id"

Ebayr.cert_id = "my-ebay-cert-id"

Ebayr.ru_name = "my-ebay-ru-name"

# Set this to true for testing in the eBay Sandbox (but remember to use the
# appropriate keys!). It's true by default.
Ebayr.sandbox = false
```

Now you're ready to make calls
```ruby
Ebayr.call(:GeteBayOfficialTime)
session = Ebayr.call(:GetSessionID, :RuName => Ebayr.ru_name)[:SessionID]
```

To use an authorized user's key, pass in an `auth_token` parameter
```ruby
Ebayr.call(:GetOrders, :auth_token => "another-ebay-auth-token")
```

Use the input option to add to the body of the call:
```ruby
# Adds "<a>1</a>" to the ebay request body
Ebayr::Request.new(:Blah, input: {a: 1})
```

Values to the `input` key can be Hashes again, which are resolved to their corresponding XML representation. Please note, that if a value in this Hash is an Array, then each of the Array's elements is wrapped in the same tag (which is the value's key), like here (1 and 2 are both wrapped in the tag `b`):
```ruby
# Adds: "<a>1</a><a><b>1</b><b>2</b></a>" to the ebay request body
args = {a: [ 1, { b: [1, 2] } ]}
Ebayr::Request.new(:Blah, :input => args)
```

However, please note, that up to version 0.0.10 Arrays in Hash values were handled differently:
```ruby
# Up to version 0.0.10:
# Adds: "<a>1</a><a><b>1</b><b>2</b></a>" to the ebay request body
args = [{ :a => 1 }, { :a => [{:b => 1 }, { :b => 2 }] }]
Ebayr::Request.new(:Blah, :input => args)
```
That is: Arrays used to have every element converted to XML, and then `join`ed. Please, use the new compact syntax; however, if you have to, you can switch the legacy syntax on with this setting:
```ruby
Ebayr.use_old_hash_to_xml_conversion = true
```

### Configuration

Ebayr will look for the following Ruby files, and load them *once* in order (if
they exist) when the module is evaluated:

1. /etc/ebayr.conf
2. /usr/local/etc/ebayr.conf
3. ~/.ebayr.conf
4. ./.ebayr.conf

You can put configuration code in there (such as the variable setting shown
above). The files should be plain old Ruby.

In a Ruby on Rails project, just create a file called
config/initializers/ebayr.rb (or something), and put the configuration there. Of
course, you should probably not check in these files, if you're using a public
repository.

## Testing

[![Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjjb/ebayr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjjb/ebayr)

When running test, you generally won't want to use up your API call-limit too
quickly, so it makes sense to stub out calls to the eBay API.

Ebayr test use [Fakeweb][2] to mimic the responses from eBay.

```ruby
require 'ebayr'
require 'test/unit'
require 'fakeweb'

class MyTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup
    Ebayr.sandbox = true
  end

  # A very contrived example...
  def test_get_ebay_time
    xml = <<-XML
      <GeteBayOfficialTimeResponse>
        <Ack>Success</Ack>
        <Timestamp>blah</Timestamp>
      </GeteBayOfficialTimeResponse>
    XML

    FakeWeb.register_uri(:post, Ebayr.uri, :body => xml)

    time = SomeWrapperThatUsesEbayr.get_ebay_time
    assert_equal 'blah', time
  end
end

class SomeWrapperThatUsesEbayr
  def self.get_ebay_time
    hash = Ebayr.call(:GeteBayOfficialTime)
    hash.timestamp
  end
end
```

See ['./test/ebayr_test.rb'](test/ebayr_test.rb) for more examples.

You need to remember to include Fakeweb in your Gemfile, or Ebayr will complain.
